Installing a Hadoop cluster typically involves unpacking the software on all the machines in the cluster or installing RPMs.

Typically one machine in the cluster is designated as the NameNode and another machine the as ResourceManager, exclusively. These are the masters.

The rest of the machines in the cluster act as both DataNode and NodeManager. These are the slaves.
